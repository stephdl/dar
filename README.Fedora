Due to fedora policy and the apparent inability of the current version of
glibc to compile a true static binary, the dar-static package/binaries have
not been built or included with this package.  If you would like to build
static binaries, you can download the source RPM file from the Fedora Extras
repository and recompile it with "--with static" to enable the static binary
and library files.
